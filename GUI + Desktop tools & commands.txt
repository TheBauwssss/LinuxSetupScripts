A good indicator for monitoring temperature, fan speeds and voltage is psensor. It shows output of all sensors, draws graphs. Also selected outputs can be placed in indicator panel.

It can be installed from Ubuntu repositories by typing:

$> sudo apt-get install psensor

Newer versions of psensor can be installed from ppa:

$> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jfi/ppa
$> sudo apt-get update
$> sudo apt-get install psensor

In some cases not all sensors are displayed. Then you can run

$> sudo sensors-detect

and answer "yes" to all questions. But is not quite safe in some cases, but I never had any real problems with that. A safer way is to take default answers.

Some additional sensors may appear.
