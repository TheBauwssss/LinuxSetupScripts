# NOTE: If IP assignments do not work, check pfSense static mappings first before spending

# Static ip on Debian 9 Stretch:

$ nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

#at the bottom type the following text:

interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.100.233/24	
static routers=192.168.100.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.100.1

#check temperature and voltage state (0x0 = no under voltage)
